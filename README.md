Finally! I completed 3D printing this laptop wall mount to address the issue of my long-overdue back pain!

I originally forked this 3D model from thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3061741

However, I had problem printing it as a whole on my Ender 3 pro due to it's size. I had to cut it half and create a connecting joint that will held the two supports together.
